Testing
--------


Model and Controller
----------------------

- Model and Controller Tests generated automatically with the Scaffolding. 





View 
------

- View Tests reside in test/controllers/ or are part of controller tests. 
  The assert_select method allows you to query HTML elements of the response by using a simple yet powerful syntax. 


- Testing the response to your request by asserting the presence of KEY html elements 
  and their CONTENT is a common way to test the views of your application. 


- Your View testing should be done with ACTUAL data. 
  Not only Seeds !
